# 4Coder Customization Layer for [Odin](http://odin-lang.org/)
4Coder Customization Layer that I use daily for **Odin**
Customizations are kept minimal for my / your sake

## Odin Features
* Keywords + Highlight
* Code Indexing (*proc, structs, enums, unions, constants*)
* Goto jumping since Code Indexing works
* Error / Lister Jumping

## How to try out
Windows: *soon*
Linux: Replace your `custom_4coder.so` with mine :tada:

## How to build
Replace all files to their corresponding locations, i.e. `custom` folder files belong to custom etc.
To get **odin** keyword lexing you have to rebuild the lexer with my custom language file

Linux: You can use my `release.sh` (rebuilds code) or `lex.sh` (rebuilds lexer and code)

## Themes
* Solarized Dark
* Nord
* Horizon

## Old 
You can browse the repo history for other extensions i used to use
